# Known bugs and limitations
- Workspace does not scale well in newer operating systems and high dpi.
- Sometimes when opening the contextmenu for a service in ServiceMonitor the menu is
opened for the wrong service.
As a temporary workaround a label is added to the top of the menu showing wich service is
selected.
- Minor GUI problems in Workspace.
- All system stat tags gets qualified to the first node in OPCServer list
- It is not possible to disable diagnostic tags for anything except calculation agent.
